# Push2run-Lite

See [Push2Run](https://www.push2run.com/) for the actual useful program you want.

This is a very light version of push2run that does the minimal amount I use.

What it does:
* Mqtt support
* Reads the export from Push2Run
* Uses very little resources
* Actually works and runs things

What it does not do:
* No configuration UI
* No installation
* Nothing other than Mqtt supported
* Doesn't support mqtt tls yet
